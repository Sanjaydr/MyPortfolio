  <H1> Brief about the graphic choice </h1>
 <h6> In the Third visualization, I decided to use a stacked bar chart to do a comparative analysis of the different countries in the American continent. I initially wanted to use the line chart to show the comparison to reduce the usage of color, but due to the constraint that we cannot use line charts, I decided to use the stacked area chart. Following the best practices learned so far, I only represented the countries in comparison and removed the redundant data. I used a contrasting color palette to ensure that the different countries were clearly visible. I added the Title and subtitle and removed data labels and axis labels since the information was straightforward using the legend. I tried to remove as much redundant information as possible so that the audience could focus on the comparative analysis. This graph also allowed me to add faint gridlines that do not obstruct the audience's view yet, at the same time, provide a guide to the y-axis value data helping correlate the values for various countries.

   <H1> Brief about the visualization </h1>
  
 <h6>The chart compares the debt-to-GDP ratio of various countries between 2015 and 2018. It is clear that the ratio for the USA was the highest among all the countries for the entire duration. The second highest debt-to-GDP ratio was for Canada. The most interesting insight was that Brazil nearly reached the ratio value as that of Canada in 2018. The third country after USA and Canada was Brazil, followed by Columbia and Mexico in the last place. Since the debt to GDP ratio tells us about the country's ability to pay back its debt, It is clear that Mexico has the lowest ability and USA has the highest ability among the countries in the American continent as per the data available.</h6>
