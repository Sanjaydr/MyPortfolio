  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Summary</span></h2>
  <p> I feel that the topic of Mental health has gained a lot of traction recently but people fail to understand the importance of mental health in a student's life. At the same time, it's necessary to showcase the appalling statistics of the dire situation. The reason I picked this topic is to convey the on-ground numbers and raise awareness of the simple ways we as students can take care of ourselves and avoid becoming a part of the statistics. Using my storyboard I would like to make my fellow college students aware of the simple actions that can help someone in need.</p>
  
  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">StoryBoard</span></h2>
 <p> I have created a list of statistics that would help create a story.
 <br>
  I would start with the hook question that would engage and grab the audience's attention. I would then talk about anxiety doubling over the years followed by the statistics about stress in College students and start my college narrative there. I would then redirect to the Levels of stress as moderate, severe, and low. Then I would move to the effects of Mental health issues like Anxiety and Depression and show statistics that frankly shocked me. I would then move on to the statistics about college students taking up alcohol, nicotine vapes, and hallucinogens to cope with mental health issues. This would lay the foundation for the fact that people do commit suicide after they cannot cope with the mental stress, depression, and/or anxiety. I would do that by showing statistics of college student suicides and finally in the call for action section make a few resources available and also talk about simple steps and mindfulness practices that can help cope with stress and other mental health issues.</p>

 <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small"> Final Visualizations</span></h1>
  
  <p> I have created 10 visualizations based off the sketches from<b><a href ="https://sanjaydr.github.io/MyPortfolio/FinalProject1" > <i>Final Project Part 1 </i></a></b> to show the broad flow of my storyboard</p>
  
  
  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Starting with a Hook Question</span></h2>
  <h3> <b><i> Are you Stressed, Anxious or Worried?</i></b></h3>
  
  
  <p><h2>Visual 1:</h2> In this visual I have used Canva to create an infographic stressing on the Anxiety doubling over time in students. My interviewee asked me to show both Anxiety and Doubled in same color to draw attention to doubling. I did that and the visual can be seen below.</p><br>

  <p><h2>Visual 2:</h2> The second visual uses Canva again to create an infographic using the human figures to show that 65.7 percent or 6.57 out of 10 students face harmful levels of anxiety and I have used red color to draw attention to the statistic.</p><br>

  <br><br>
  
   <p><h2>Visual 4:</h2> In this visual I elaborate even further on the Mental stress level and show the levels as Low, Moderate and Severe in the form of a donut chart. I have used gradation Fron red to green to indicate the levels.</p><br>

   <p><h2>Visual 5:</h2> This is a rough sketch for what would be a direct comparison between the time students spend on study outside of classes versus the time spent on entertainment every week in a typical work week. I have used red for Study time to show strss and green to show relaxation or break through entertainment.</p><br>

   <p><h2>Visual 6:</h2> From this visual I want to convey the depression statistics and I have used the big number in the middle to capture attention of the audience with the alarming number. I would use this to move into the adverse coping methods that college students turn to. I have used the graphic of a person resting on the number to show relation between the number and the depression of the pgraphic character.</p><br>

   <p><h2>Visual 7:</h2>This visual represents the coparsion of students consuming marijuana. I have used the leaf symbol to represent the percentage since that makes the data self explanatory. I incorporated the peer feedback and used the size to represent the consumption instead of graph.</p><br>

   <p><h2>Visual 10:</h2> The last visual is for the suicide statistics. This simple trend line in the form of a noose shows the suicide rates with th eline being the rope making the visual more impactful.I was a bit apprehensive about the visual being sensitive but the interviewees showed very positive reponse to the visual.</p><br>

  After the visuals I would add a section on Call for action with all the resources along with helpline numbers and a few small steps every individual can take to proactively keep mental health in check. Since my audience is CMU students, I have added the pictures from thre CMU website that I would be using to show the available resources. I have also added the link below whic I would embed in my Shorthand page as well. I am also in conversation with CMU CAPS to help me with resources on how each individual can take care of themselves and keep a check on themselves proactively. I am still in conversation and I will have some update by next week and have those incorporated in the Shorthand storyboard. <br><br><br>

  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Research Protocol</span></h2><br>
<h2>1. The target audience you hope to reach with your story</h2><br>
Since my storyboard talks about student mental health status, the target audience that I would like to reach with my story board or college level students who are combating with this issue Day in Day out. Even though it’s a very common thing to have weak mental health, there is not much that the students are doing about it the storyboard would serve as an instrument to bring about that small change, which would help students to take some very small steps , but create massive impact on the mental health status.<br><br>


<h2>2. The approach to identifying representative individuals to interview</h2><br>
Since the story board is about college level students, anyone from Carnegie Mellon university would be a valid candidate. However, I would be recruiting individuals who have some background in data visualization since that would help me improve my visuals not only for the required audiences that is any student, but would also give me certain pointers that would help me improve my visualization in the best way possible. My aim is to pick at least one student who has some background data visualization and the other two could be any students from Carnegie Mellon University this way I would get to interact with the broader set of audience and get different perspectives on the same storyline.<br><br>






<h2>3. The interview script</h2><br>
Hi! Thank You for your time. The agenda for today's interview is to get your honest feedback on the Visuals and Story flow. I would like you to see the visuals and try to interpret the visuals the best you can, and at the same time provide any feedback or critique that you could provide on all the visualizations. I would also like you to help me understand whether the flow of my story suits the visualizations or if I should make any amends to the flow to make it better. <br>
I would like to first start by setting up the context for this story board. The intention of the storyboard is to talk about the deteriorating, mental health state of college students in the United States of America. It also showcases the effects on college students because of deteriorating mental health, and also by using various visual infographics, I have tried to bring to light things that I usually talked about, but do not have any action taken in order to combat them. I would be ending with a call for action section which would give us various resources to to combat the mental health issues we face in our daily lives. 
I would then show each visual to the interviewee, and ask them the following questions for each of them .
<br>
<ol><li>What do you like about this visual?</li>
  <li>What do you think can be improved about this visual?</li>
    <li> What do you think is the purpose of this visual?</li>
      <li>Do you think this is the appropriate position for the visual in the flow?</li>
</ol>
<br>
Based on the above questions, I would identify changes if any, and use this feedback to incorporate the required changes in my final presentation.
<br><br>








<h2> 4. The findings from your interviews</h2><br>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ol><li>
  The interviewees in general really like the topic, and could relate to the topic.</li>

<li>
    One interviewee thought that starting witha  question was a great idea and got him very interested as they related to the issue. </li>

<li>I was really apprehensive about using the news in one of the charts showing statistics about suicide rates, but the interviewees responded really well to the charts and they thought that the use of the rope was a very clever way to make the visual more impactful.</li>

<li> The infographics and use of Canva played out to my advantage, and made the overall storyline more impactful.</li></ol>


<h2>Areas of Improvement </h2>
<ol>
<li>In the first visual, one of the interviewees thought that anxiety and Doubled should both be of the same color in order to draw attention to the relationship between anxiety getting doubled.</li>

<li>The charts were missing sources and all of the individuals thought that stating sources was very important to give credibility to the charts.</li>

<li>In most of my visuals I had used only red yellow and green colors so another common pointer was to use different colors.
</li>
<li>One of the interviewees thought that I should consider using colors in the titles to highlight the important parts just like I had done in the case of anxiety getting double in the first visual.</li>

<li>Two of the interviewees thought that the vertical grid lines in visual five were distracting, and could be removed to make it more effective.</li>





<h2> 4. The findings from Peer Critique</h2><br>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ol><li>
  The flow of the information is smooth.</li>

<li>
   Adding the graphics with some animations was a nice way to have that impact needed. </li>

<li>The way of representing Coping using Marijuana, Nicotine Vapes and Hallucinogens made it easy to understand what it represents.</li>




<h2>Areas of Improvement </h2>
<ol>
<li>For the Pie Chart I could remove the color and grey out everything except for increase in stress to reduce color usage.</li>

<li>For the donut chart I could keep the color except for the No/Low and grey out the section to ensure removal of redundant color.</li>

<li>For the Last Chart again I had a devided group regarding use of noose and a point of sensitivity. I will think more on how to have the sam impact without creating controversy.</li>



<h2>5. Changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified</h2><br>
 I have decided to consider all the five changes that I got as feedback from my interview is and would be incorporating all five in this part itself. I thought that these were very basic changes and would make a great impact on visuals created. Since these changes but also not very time consuming, I decided to go ahead and make most of the changes now  so that later I could focus on the story board part of the project in shorthand, since I am not very well-versed with short hand, and would take some time to learn the platform.
  
<br>
  
  For the feedback from peers also, i have decided to use them and incorporate them in my final project. I rellay liked their perspective and I could see the difference in the feedback in terms of the nuances that my peers could pick up on because they understood how to further improve the visuals based on learning from class.
