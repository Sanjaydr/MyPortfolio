  </header>
   
  
  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Summary</span></h2>
  <p> I feel that the topic of Mental health has gained a lot of traction recently but people fail to understand the importance of mental health in a student's life. At the same time, it's necessary to showcase the appalling statistics of the dire situation. The reason I picked this topic is to convey the on-ground numbers and raise awareness of the simple ways we as students can take care of ourselves and avoid becoming a part of the statistics. Using my storyboard I would like to make my fellow college students aware of the simple actions that can help someone in need.</p>
  
  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">StoryBoard</span></h2>
 <p> I have created a list of statistics that would help create a story.
 <br>
  I would start with the statistics about stress in College students. I would then redirect to the Levels of stress as moderate, severe, and low. Then I would move to the effects of Mental health issues like Anxiety and Depression and show statistics that frankly shocked me. I would then move on to the statistics about college students taking up alcohol, nicotine vapes, and hallucinogens to cope with mental health issues. This would lay the foundation for the fact that people do commit suicide after they cannot cope with the mental stress, depression, and/or anxiety. I would do that by showing statistics of college student suicides and finally in the call for action section make a few resources available and also talk about simple steps and mindfulness practices that can help cope with stress and other mental health issues.</p>

 <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small"> Final Visualizations</span></h1>
  
  <p> I have created 10 visualizations based off the sketches from<b><a href ="https://sanjaydr.github.io/MyPortfolio/FinalProject1" > <i>Final Project Part 1 </i></a></b> to show the broad flow of my storyboard</p>
  
  
   <h2 class="w3-jumbo">Starting with a Hook Question</h2>
  <h3> <b><i> Are you Stressed, Anxious or Worried?</i></b></h3>
  
  
  <p><h2>Visual 1:</h2> In this visual I have used Canva to create an infographic stressing on the Anxiety doubling over time in students. My interviewee asked me to show both Anxiety and Doubled in same color to draw attention to doubling. I did that and the visual can be seen below.</p><br>
<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 16.0000%;

  <p><h2>Visual 2:</h2> The second visual uses Canva again to create an infographic using the human figures to show that 65.7 percent or 6.57 out of 10 students face harmful levels of anxiety and I have used red color to draw attention to the statistic.</p><br>
   <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 40.0000%;

   <p><h2>Visual 3:</h2> The next visual adds on to the metal health by introducing Covid-19 as a factor adding to the stress and shows the impact of Covid -19 on stress levels of college students.</p><br>
  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11344247"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  
  
  <br><br>
  
   <p><h2>Visual 4:</h2> In this visual I elaborate even further on the Mental stress level and show the levels as Low, Moderate and Severe in the form of a donut chart. I have used gradation Fron red to green to indicate the levels.</p><br>
  
  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11344360"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  
  <br><br>
   
   
   
   <p><h2>Visual 5:</h2> This is a rough sketch for what would be a direct comparison between the time students spend on study outside of classes versus the time spent on entertainment every week in a typical work week. I have used red for Study time to show strss and green to show relaxation or break through entertainment.</p><br>
   
   <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11345449"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
   
   <br><br>
   
   
   
   <p><h2>Visual 6:</h2> From this visual I want to convey the depression statistics and I have used the big number in the middle to capture attention of the audience with the alarming number. I would use this to move into the adverse coping methods that college students turn to. I have used the graphic of a person resting on the number to show relation between the number and the depression of the pgraphic character.</p><br>

   <p><h2>Visual 7:</h2>This visual represents the coparsion of students consuming marijuana. I have used the leaf symbol to represent the percentage since that makes the data self explanatory. I incorporated the peer feedback and used the size to represent the consumption instead of graph.</p><br>

   <br><br>
   
   
   <p><h2>Visual 8:</h2> In this visual I have emphasized on the use of Hallucinogens like LSD growth and used the upward arrrow to indicate growth in use by college students. I incorporated the peer feedback and used the size to represent the consumption instead of graph</p><br>

   <p><h2>Visual 9:</h2> This visual shows that the nicotine vapes have doubled in use over the years and I used the vape pen to show the statistic using size as a factor of consumption over time. I incorporated the peer feedback and used the size to represent the consumption instead of graph</p><br>

   <p><h2>Visual 10:</h2> The last visual is for the suicide statistics. This simple trend line in the form of a noose shows the suicide rates with th eline being the rope making the visual more impactful.I was a bit apprehensive about the visual being sensitive but the interviewees showed very positive reponse to the visual.</p><br>

  After the sketches I would add a section on Call for action with all the resources along with helpline numbers and a few small steps every individual can take to proactively keep mental health in check. Since my audience is CMU students, I have added the pictures from thre CMU website that I would be using to show the available resources. I have also added the link below whic I would embed in my Shorthand page as well. I am also in conversation with CMU CAPS to help me with resources on how each individual can take care of themselves and keep a check on themselves proactively. I am still in conversation and I will have some update by next week and have those incorporated in the Shorthand storyboard. <br><br><br>
