  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Part 1: Finding a data visualization to use </span></h1>
  <p> Initially, when this assignment was released, I had a hundred ideas floating in my head for the different visuals that I had seen in the past and what I could potentially use for my assignment. But, when I started working on the assignment I realized that the biggest issue I faced was that the different visuals that caught my attention either did not have the data used to create the embedded visual or the data set was so massive that flourish and tableau were getting stuck due to limited compute capacity of my system. Then I decided to look through the OECD data visualizations and came across this very interesting graph. The title "Working age population, Total, % of the population, 1970 – 2021" caught my attention but the visual was badly made. So I decided to work on that visual as my visual for the assignment. </p>

  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Part 3: Sketching out the solution </span></h1>
 <p>   The next step after critiquing the visualization was to sketch out what I felt was the best way to represent the data and to set the context that I felt was appropriate for the visualization. To accomplish this I selected five countries. India, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the USA. The idea was to compare the growth in the working population in developed countries to developing countries. The reason behind choosing these countries was that in developing countries the growth over the years in the percentage of the population of working age was very high as compared to USA and UK which was pretty much parallel. I wanted to highlight the exponential growth of India and Korea over the years. <br>
To make my sketch more appealing I used different colors for each county. I labeled them using the same color as the line for each country. I also added Labels for the axes to make it more clear and eliminated redundant information making the required information highlighted clearly.

  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Part 4: Testing the sketched solution </span></h1>
  
  <p> I tested the sketched solution by conducting 2 interviews. I have added a link to the interviews in the section below. The interviews helped me with feedback and improved the overall visualization. Both interviewees felt that they could understand the information well. both participants felt that the title should be changed to represent something that would help capture the audience's attention to the information being conveyed. Interviewee 1 felt that the x-axis and y-axis needed the labels to be removed where as the other participant needed them. Interviewee 1 felt that an area chart would represent the data better and the second interviewee felt that staring the x-axis from 1970 and y-axis from 50% instead of 0 would help make it more clear to the audience.

  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Part 4B: Feedback from peers in class </span></h2>
<p> I feel that this additional step of getting feedback from peers in class in the form of group activity was a great step in the process. It not only helped me get great feedback from my peers who are learning and applying the same concepts we learn in class but also get ideas on different ways to represent my narrative in the journal form. Along with the activity, I feel that the four questions that were handed to us helped us structure our feedback, and hence I received some great feedback that I incorporated into my visualization. I received the following feedback that I incorporated into the final solution that I built on flourish - <br><br>
  1. The title should be more catchy so I decided to use " The massive rise Indian and Korean population in working age".<br><br>
  2. The title should highlight India and Korea in the same color as the lines in the graph (I could not achieve this in flourish hence I added the title on Github and highlighted the text there) I found this very effective in drawing attention to what I want to showcase. <br><br>
  3. I built the final solution as an area graph based on interview feedback. But my peer group suggested I keep the visual as a line graph since the area graph did not capture the exponential growth well and the colors were causing distraction and eye travel. </p>


  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Part 5: Building out the tested solution </span></h1> <p>
   I built out the final solution using Flourish and incorporated the feedback from the interviews as well as from the peer review session in class. I feel that this activity helped me understand the entire process from selecting a visual to creating a final solution that I clear and conveys the right information., I feel pretty confident that I can now pick any visualization and critique and/or redesign it for easier interpretation for a wide variety of audiences. </p> <br><br>
