  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Summary of my process</span></h1>
 <p> For the final part of my project, the most essential component that I understood, based on the comments that I received on the previous two parts, was that I should connect with mental health service providers like CMU CaPS, and get an opinion on the entire story to ensure that the right verbiage and content was used to deliver the story more effectively. <br><br>
The second most important component of the third part of my project was to ensure that the story flow was smooth that each element's position was the right one for that particular element and that it fits perfectly into the storyline that I had envisioned. <br><br>
Lastly, I also want to ensure that the message of deteriorating mental health among college students is delivered with empathy. I tried my level best to be mindful when selecting the different images that supported my storyline and the transition slides for the section headers.<br></p>
  
  <h2> Meeting wuth CMU Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) Counsellor </h2>
  <p>I think that my conversation with CMU CaPS was one of the most important steps in finalizing my shorthand story. To get correct and appropriate feedback on my project and storyline, I met with one of the counselors at CaPS and showed them my storyboard. I walk them through my process by showing them the initial sketches that I had prepared for the first part followed by the feedback, received, and how I improved on the sketches and digitize them in part 2. Once I completed the walk-through, I conducted a quick interview to understand the counselor's stance on the visuals that I had used. Based on the answer from the counselor, it was clear that all the statistics and visuals that I had designed and digitized were impactful, except for one. <br><br>
The line chart that depicted the suicide rate in college students where I had added a noose at the end of the line graph did not sit well with the counselor. She explained how the entire impact that was created by the storyboard would be lost just because of that one small graphic detail, and how I might lose out on my entire audience's engagement because of the hurt that the visual may cause. Further, we also discussed the story flow and whether I should add a contact setting paragraph in the beginning, but the counselor suggested that I don’t add any textual paragraphs and instead show them the statistics to have that hook on the audience, which would have been otherwise lost while setting the context, I also ensured that Iran, all the visuals, images, graphics, etc through the counselor so that I was sure about the language used in the storyboard. One major feedback that I received was to have images to set contacts instead of text. In the counselor's words, images and pictures said 1 million words which could not be accommodated in 2 or 3 sentences of text. I also asked the counselor if I should change any other aspect of my project to have more impact, or if there were any resources that I could flag, which would help students deal with the struggles of their mental health issues. The counselor also provided me with all the resources that are available to the students which I also added to my storyboard at the end in the call to action section. I feel like this conversation with the counselor made a really big positive impact on the overall quality of my final project.

  <h2> The Audience </h2>
  <p> In terms of the audience for my project, I initially picked all college students across the United States of America. Later, based on my discussion with CMU CaPS I realized that the resources or the help that I could provide would be diluted if I tried to address the problem, at the national level. Hence, I decided to update the entire storyline considering only CMU college students as my audience. this process of changing my audience also had an impact on the content of my story.<br> Now, the call for action section towards the end of the project talks about the different mental health resources that are available to all Carnegie Mellon students. While researching for the resources and talking to the CMU CaPS team, the biggest realization factor was that CaPS by itself was a very broad umbrella and had tons of resources for the students. Most of these resources were unknown to me before this research and conversation with the CaPS team and I feel that these resources have added a lot of value to my project.</p> 
  
  <h2> Design Decisions </h2>
  In terms of the design of the entire storyboard, I had thought that I would use a plain white background to set a Sombre theme but the white background was not conveying the dark situation of college student's mental health. Hence, I decided to use a dark theme for the entire project. along with the dog theme I made sure that I had different pictures used in terms of the transition slides as well as accompanying the content which helped build the storyline and flow. The content helped build the storyline and flow. These pictures added a lot more meaning to the text used as connectors for different points in the story. Initially, my story had a total of 10 statistical visuals and 3 to 4 more pages that were, helping me build the flow but later, based on my discussion with the CaPS team I realize that I should add more transition slides with headings and images that would help convey the distressing situation. <br><br>
Also, in bought one and do I had decided to name my project “ mental health crisis“ but, when I was creating my shorthand story, I realized that the title was not doing justice to the content, as the content was only for college students mental health and not for the general public. hence, I decided to rename my project and finalize the title as “colleges have a distressing mental health problem”. I feel that this title emphasizes more on the situation, as well as the audience for which the story is intended. <br><br>
Further,  the biggest design decision that I had to take, and that was reflected in both part one and part two feedback was whether I should use a nose photograph that depicted an increase in the suicide rate of college students. There were a lot of opinions on whether I should use that, and if using, the news would create the impact that I intended but based on my discussion with CaPS, I realized that if a person is struggling with mental health issues, so the story it would not be motivating for them to use the resources that are outlined in the story and the visualization may hurt the audience, thus demotivating them to continue reading the remaining part of the story. Hence, in the final part, while creating my Shorthand story, I decided to remove that noose and keep the graph with a deep, red color line indicating that it was a worrying statistic.<br><br>
Apart from the line chart, I feel all other charts that I have used in my storyline have remained the same, and I was very happy with the way that all the charts had turned out and we’re showcasing the statistics that I wanted to emphasize. At the same time, I took all the feedback that I received from the interviews and peer review sessions and made changes to my overall shorthand page. One particular change that I made to my shorthand page. What is that I added context by highlighting the statistics in text form, so that the visualization were interpreted in the intended manner. I wanted to ensure that none of the visualizations misrepresented the information and that the data sources were highlighted, not only in the references but also in the footer of each visual, so that the audience could dive deeper if they wanted to.<br>


  <h2> What I learned through the process </h2>
  <p>I feel that I learned a lot throughout this process of creating the storyboard. I feel that this project was not like any other project that I’ve done at CMU because this project let me understand the dire situation of college student's mental health as compared to the other projects that majorly revolved around technology. Since this topic was very close to me, I tried to do justice by adding all the visuals and statistics that I found online which added value to the story. Through the process, I learned a lot about designing for your audience and improving through Feedback.<br><br> 
As I went through the different parts of this project, I learned how to design effectively by keeping the audience in mind. Initially, the entire story was created for a very wide audience, which was all college students across the United States of America but based on my conversations with my peers and CMU CaPS, I realized that it was too broad an audience, and that, I would not be able to do justice to the audience that was reading my storyboard. I realize that my storyboard would be read primarily by Carnegie Mellon students and that if I wanted to make a more impactful storyboard I should address the immediate audience (CMU college students).<br><br>
I also learned that feedback loops made my visuals better, and my story stronger because they gave me an outside view of my story that I could have never otherwise seen. These feedback loops not only help me with the overall structure of my story but also strengthened each visual that I used in my story based on the optical element as well as the best practices of designing. This process also made me realize that the more iterations you do to a project which involves design elements and visualization the better the outcome. I feel that I have learned a lot about visualization and using variations in color and font to make more impactful visuals and this skill would help me become a better leader in my career ahead. I also learned that we tend to make a lot of mistakes which get rectified as we go through the iterative process and get feedback from our immediate peers.</p><br>
