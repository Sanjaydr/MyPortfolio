  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Summary of my process</span></h1>
 <p> For the final part of my project, the most essential component that I understood, based on the comments that I received on the previous two parts, was that I should connect with mental health service providers like CMU CaPS, and get an opinion on the entire story to ensure that the right verbiage and content was used to deliver the story more effectively. <br><br>
The second most important component of the third part of my project was to ensure that the story flow was smooth that each element's position was the right one for that particular element and that it fits perfectly into the storyline that I had envisioned. <br><br>
Lastly, I also want to ensure that the message of deteriorating mental health among college students is delivered with empathy. I tried my level best to be mindful when selecting the different images that supported my storyline and the transition slides for the section headers.<br></p>
  
  <h2> The Audience </h2>
  <p> In terms of the audience for my project, I initially picked all college students across the United States of America. Later, based on my discussion with CMU CaPS I realized that the resources or the help that I could provide would be diluted if I tried to address the problem, at the national level. Hence, I decided to update the entire storyline considering only CMU college students as my audience. this process of changing my audience also had an impact on the content of my story.<br> Now, the call for action section towards the end of the project talks about the different mental health resources that are available to all Carnegie Mellon students. While researching for the resources and talking to the CMU CaPS team, the biggest realization factor was that CaPS by itself was a very broad umbrella and had tons of resources for the students. Most of these resources were unknown to me before this research and conversation with the CaPS team and I feel that these resources have added a lot of value to my project.</p> 
  
  <h2> Design Decisions </h2>
  In terms of the design of the entire storyboard, I had thought that I would use a plain white background to set a Sombre theme but the white background was not conveying the dark situation of college student's mental health. Hence, I decided to use a dark theme for the entire project. along with the dog theme I made sure that I had different pictures used in terms of the transition slides as well as accompanying the content which helped build the storyline and flow. The content helped build the storyline and flow. These pictures added a lot more meaning to the text used as connectors for different points in the story. Initially, my story had a total of 10 statistical visuals and 3 to 4 more pages that were, helping me build the flow but later, based on my discussion with the CaPS team I realize that I should add more transition slides with headings and images that would help convey the distressing situation. <br><br>
Also, in bought one and do I had decided to name my project “ mental health crisis“ but, when I was creating my shorthand story, I realized that the title was not doing justice to the content, as the content was only for college students mental health and not for the general public. hence, I decided to rename my project and finalize the title as “colleges have a distressing mental health problem”. I feel that this title emphasizes more on the situation, as well as the audience for which the story is intended. <br><br>
Further,  the biggest design decision that I had to take, and that was reflected in both part one and part two feedback was whether I should use a nose photograph that depicted an increase in the suicide rate of college students. There were a lot of opinions on whether I should use that, and if using, the news would create the impact that I intended but based on my discussion with CaPS, I realized that if a person is struggling with mental health issues, so the story it would not be motivating for them to use the resources that are outlined in the story and the visualization may hurt the audience, thus demotivating them to continue reading the remaining part of the story. Hence, in the final part, while creating my Shorthand story, I decided to remove that noose and keep the graph with a deep, red color line indicating that it was a worrying statistic.<br><br>
Apart from the line chart, I feel all other charts that I have used in my storyline have remained the same, and I was very happy with the way that all the charts had turned out and we’re showcasing the statistics that I wanted to emphasize. At the same time, I took all the feedback that I received from the interviews and peer review sessions and made changes to my overall shorthand page. One particular change that I made to my shorthand page. What is that I added context by highlighting the statistics in text form, so that the visualization were interpreted in the intended manner. I wanted to ensure that none of the visualizations misrepresented the information and that the data sources were highlighted, not only in the references but also in the footer of each visual, so that the audience could dive deeper if they wanted to.<br>
  
  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Structure</span></h1>
 <p> I have created a list of statistics that would help create a story.
 <br>
  I would start with the statistics about stress in College students. I would then redirect to the Levels of stress as moderate, severe, and low. Then I would move to the effects of Mental health issues like Anxiety and Depression and show statistics that frankly shocked me. I would then move on to the statistics about college students taking up alcohol, nicotine vapes, and hallucinogens to cope with mental health issues. This would lay the foundation for the fact that people do commit suicide after they cannot cope with the mental stress, depression, and/or anxiety. I would do that by showing statistics of college student suicides and finally in the call for action section make a few resources available and also talk about simple steps and mindfulness practices that can help cope with stress and other mental health issues.</p>
