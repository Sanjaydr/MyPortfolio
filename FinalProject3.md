  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Outline</span></h1>
  <p> For my final project, I had an idea to pick something that was close to me and something that everyone in the room could relate to. hence I picked the topic of the Mental Health crisis faced by College Students in the United States of America. As a college student, I have faced a lot of Stress and Mental Health issues personally due</p> to the immense pressure of the coursework and facing deadlines and the job search as well. </p>
  
  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Summary of my process</span></h2>
 <p> For the final part of my project, the most essential component that I understood, based on the comments that I received on the previous two parts, was that I should connect with mental health service providers like CMU CaPS, and get an opinion on the entire story to ensure that the right verbiage and content was used to deliver the story more effectively. <br>
The second most important component of the third part of my project was to ensure that the story flow was smooth that each element's position was the right one for that particular element and that it fits perfectly into the storyline that I had envisioned. <br>
Lastly, I also want to ensure that the message of deteriorating mental health among college students is delivered with empathy. I tried my level best to be mindful when selecting the different images that supported my storyline and the transition slides for the section headers.</p>
  
  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Structure</span></h2>
 <p> I have created a list of statistics that would help create a story.
 <br>
  I would start with the statistics about stress in College students. I would then redirect to the Levels of stress as moderate, severe, and low. Then I would move to the effects of Mental health issues like Anxiety and Depression and show statistics that frankly shocked me. I would then move on to the statistics about college students taking up alcohol, nicotine vapes, and hallucinogens to cope with mental health issues. This would lay the foundation for the fact that people do commit suicide after they cannot cope with the mental stress, depression, and/or anxiety. I would do that by showing statistics of college student suicides and finally in the call for action section make a few resources available and also talk about simple steps and mindfulness practices that can help cope with stress and other mental health issues.</p>
