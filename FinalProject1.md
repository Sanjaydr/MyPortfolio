  </header>
   
  
  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Outline</span></h1>
  <p> For my final project I had an idea to pick something that was close to me and something that everyone in the room could relate with. hence I picked the topic on Mental Health crisis faced by College Students in United States of America. As a college student, I have faced a lot of Stress and Mental Health issues personally due to the immense pressure of the coursework and facing deadlines and the job search as well. </p>
  
  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Summary</span></h2>
  <p> I feel that the topic of Mental health has gained a lot of traction recently but people fail to understand the importance of mental health in a student's life. At the same time, it's necessary to showcase the appalling statistics of the dire situation. The reason I picked this topic is to convey the on-ground numbers and raise awareness of the simple ways we as students can take care of ourselves and avoid becoming a part of the statistics. Using my storyboard I would like to make my fellow college students aware of the simple actions that can help someone in need.</p>
  
  <h2 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Structure</span></h2>
 <p> I have created a list of statistics that would help create a story.
 <br>
  I would start with the statistics about stress in College students. I would then redirect to the Levels of stress as moderate, severe, and low. Then I would move to the effects of Mental health issues like Anxiety and Depression and show statistics that frankly shocked me. I would then move on to the statistics about college students taking up alcohol, nicotine vapes, and hallucinogens to cope with mental health issues. This would lay the foundation for the fact that people do commit suicide after they cannot cope with the mental stress, depression, and/or anxiety. I would do that by showing statistics of college student suicides and finally in the call for action section make a few resources available and also talk about simple steps and mindfulness practices that can help cope with stress and other mental health issues.</p>

 <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Initial Sketches</span></h1>
  
  <p> I have created 10 sketches to show the broad flow of my storyboard</p>
  
  
  <p><h2>Sketch 1:</h2> This sketch is the starting point and draws attention by using large font size and vibrant colors to talk about the GROWTH in ANXIETY rates.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/1.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
   <p><h2>Sketch 2:</h2> The second sketch uses the human figures to show that 65.7 percent or 6.57 out of 10 students face harmful levels of anxiety and I have used red color to draw attention to the statistic.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/2.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
   <p><h2>Sketch 3:</h2> The next sketch adds on to the metal health by introducing Covid-19 as a factor adding to the stress and shows the impact of Covid -19 on stress levels.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/3.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
  
   <p><h2>Sketch 4:</h2> In this sketch I elaborate even further on the Mental stress level and show the levels as Low, Moderate and Severe in the form of a donut chart. I have used gradation Fron red to green to indicate the levels.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/5.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
   <p><h2>Sketch 5:</h2> This is a rough sketch for what would be a direct comparison between the time students spend on study outside of classes versus the time spent on entertainment every week in a typical work week. I have used red for Study time to show strss and green to show relaxation or break through entertainment.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/6.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
   <p><h2>Sketch 6:</h2> From this sketch I want to convey the depression statistics and I have used the big number in the middle to capture attention of the audience with the alarming number. I would use thsi to move into the adverse coping methods that college students turn to.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/7.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
   <p><h2>Sketch 7:</h2>This sketch represents the coparsion of students consuming marijuana. i have used the leaf symbol to represent the percentage since that makes the data self explanatory. </p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/8.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
   <p><h2>Sketch 8:</h2> In this sketch I have emphasized on the use of Hallucinogens like LSD growth and used the upward arrrow to indicate growth in use by college students.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/9.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
   <p><h2>Sketch 9:</h2> This sketch shows that the nicotine vapes have doubled in use over the years and I will use the vape pen in place of the bar to show the statistic.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/10.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
   <p><h2>Sketch 10:</h2> The last sketch is for the suicide statistics. this simple trend line would be used to show the suicide rates. I would use a rope with a noose at the end to make the graph more impactful.</p><br>
   <img src="https://sanjaydr.github.io/hello-world/4.jpeg" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
  
  After the sketches I would add a section on Call for action with all the resources along with helpline numbers and a few small steps every individual can take to proactively keep mental health in check. <br><br><br>
  
  
  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">The Data</span></h1>
  <p> I have used the data from various articles and antional surveys. I have used the data from the Survey done by American College Health Association, National Institue on Drug Abuse website, statista, timely-md website and American Foundation fro Suicide Prevention. these data sources provided me with the required data to be able to create an impactful story and highlight something that is hidden in plain sight. The dire situation requires our attention and the data point will make an impact not only by making aware but also using these national assiociations as a method to help people fighting these issues and help them with resources and make them better equipped tocombat mental health issues. <br>
I have used the most recent data available to make the statistics and vizualization more relevant to the audience. I have also spent a lot of time hand picking the data that could be represented in the most impactful flow of events.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Method and Medium</span></h1>
  I would be using Shorthand as the Medium. I really liked the way that shorthand made the storybord flow very smooth. I also really like the animations possible since they added teh added impact for the audience. As I saw teh different samples I realized that by using various royalty free and copyright free sources such as "Pexels and Unsplash" I could add background images that would showcase the flow evern better. I feel that I could leverage tools like "Canva" to create my own vizualizations for Sketches 12, 5, 7, 9 and 10 to create customized vizualizations by combining various elements for added emphasis. <br>
I will also consider creating a shorted version on shorthand for the 1 minute presentation to ensure that the context and flow is not lost as I present my story in a short time of 1 minute. I would take up the different statistics and combine them to get that flow. The Methodology to be used is simple, I would just try to have everything on one platform (Shorthand) at the end after creating vizualizations on flourish, Tableau, Canva and add images from the websites mentioned to bring it all together. This would help me have a lasting impact on my audience and show the tough reality and provide resource to those in need.
  
 <br><br>
  <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><span class="w3-hide-small">Feedback from peers in class</span></h1>
  The feedback session in class was really helpful in understanding the small issues that I had overlooked and can change while implementing the final solution. The following points were provided as feedback on my sketches and flow - <br>
  <h2> Pros </h2><br>
  <ul><li>The flow looks good and helps with the narrative </li>
  <li>The Infographics are great </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Areas of Improvement </h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Be careful for the graphics especially fro sensitive situations/topics like suicide </li>
  <li>For the infographics, use size to show change over time instead of plotting on graph</li>
  <li>Use more colors not just red and green to account for the colorblind</li>
  <li>Start with a Question as a Hook to the audience</li>
  </ul>
